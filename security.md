# Security
YourBase Test Acceleration library is secure. Under no circumstance do your code or your dependency graphs ever touch YourBase Test Acceleration servers.

## Telemetry
By default, YourBase Test Acceleration collects anonymized data about how the YourBase Test Acceleration library is behaving to help resolve technical issues and develop the product with people's use-cases in mind. The [data collected using telemetry is documented here](https://yourbase.io/data-usage). 

You can opt out of sending telemetry data to the YourBase Test Acceleration team, by setting the environment variable [YOURBASE_TELEMETRY](environment-variables.md#yourbase_telemetry) to `false`.

If YourBase Test Acceleration changes the type of data that it collects, it will always inform you at runtime.
